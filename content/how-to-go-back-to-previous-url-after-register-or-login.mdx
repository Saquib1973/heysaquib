```javascript
if (session?.user?.role === 'admin') {
  router.push('/admin')
} else {
  const previousPath = document.referrer
  const previousUrl = previousPath ? new URL(previousPath) : null
  const isPreviousRouteHomepage =
    previousUrl &&
    (previousUrl.pathname === '/' || previousUrl.pathname === '')

  if (
    previousUrl &&
    !isPreviousRouteHomepage &&
    previousUrl.origin === window.location.origin
  ) {
    router.back()
  } else {
    router.push('/learn')
  }
}
```

## How it works?

If user is admin simply redirect to _"/admin"_
```javascript
if (session?.user?.role === 'admin') {
  router.push('/admin')
}
```
else we need to check whether user is coming from _"/"_ [Home Route] or a specific Route
- if user comes from Home route redirect to a CTA page [here _"/learn"_]
- else redirect to previous page


previousPath stores the last page user was on
```javascript
const previousPath = document.referrer
```

parse previousPath into URL , now if the pathname for this previousUrl is _"/"_ or _""_ then the previous page might be home page to confirm check if the origin is same as current [what if the user is on some other page and comes to our login page from there]
```javascript
const previousPath = document.referrer
const previousUrl = previousPath ? new URL(previousPath) : null
const isPreviousRouteHomepage =
  previousUrl &&
  (previousUrl.pathname === '/' || previousUrl.pathname === '')

if (
  previousUrl &&
  !isPreviousRouteHomepage &&
  previousUrl.origin === window.location.origin
) {
  router.back()
} else {
  router.push('/learn')
}
```
