## About Me

Salaam! I am **Saquib**, a passionate developer from India. I have a deep interest in **full-stack development**, **system design**, and **problem-solving**.

I have worked on projects involving **React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB**. I explore new technologies, and engage in competitive programming.

## What This Blog is About 📝

I've always wanted to maintain a personal blog to document my learning, projects, and experiences. Over the years, I have followed blogs like **Paul Stamatiou, Daring Fireball, and The Loop**, learning the importance of **personal branding**—especially in the digital era.

If you build websites, create software, or even run an online business, having a personal space on the web helps showcase your work and ideas. This blog is my way of doing that, and I hope to share insights, projects, and experiences that might help others.

Apart from my technical work, I enjoy **writing about programming, reviewing new technologies, sharing problem-solving techniques, and documenting my learnings**. If it interests me, it will most likely end up here!
